# Robust FFT-Based Image Registration Tools for Python
This program provides robust image registration method using "Phase Correlation" technique.

With this toolbox, you can estimate 
Translation, Rotation and Scaling between two images.

Output form is supported: Affine Matrix, each parameter

# Getting started 
## Requirements
- Python3.X (3.5 is recommended)
- opencv-python
- opencv-contrib-python
- numpy
- matplotlib

Recommend opencv version is 3.X.
For windows users, **anaconda** is one of the choise to install both of this.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/YoshiRi/ImRegPOC
python setup.py install
```
